The revolution led to the overthrow of King Louis XVI, the rise of radical political groups, and years of violence including the Reign of Terror. Eventually, the monarchy was abolished and replaced by a republic. The revolution profoundly reshaped French society and politics and had a lasting influence on the development of modern democracies around the world.\n",
            "Summarize the following text:  The French Revolution began in 1789 and was a period of significant political and social upheaval in France. It was driven by widespread discontent with the monarchy, rising inequality, economic hardship, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas about liberty, equality, and fraternity. The revolution led to the overthrow of King Louis XVI, the rise of radical political groups, and years of violence including the Reign of Terror. Eventually, the monarchy was abolished and replaced by a republic. The revolution profoundly reshaped French society and politics and had a lasting influence on the development of modern democracies around the world.\n",
